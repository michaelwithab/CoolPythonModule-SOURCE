This module, does some random stuff, while being free and open source forever.

# Why in the world did you make this?
I honestly do not know, it just popped up while I was listening to [Vibing in the 20s by Evan King / Context Sensitive](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=M94eN-YLbOs). I used [ReplIt](replit.com) and it's Python Package template, made up a gibberish name for the project, and boom!

# THE END
